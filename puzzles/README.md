## Puzzles

Look at the Steps 1-9 in [this](./../create-webshell/README.md) README file.

You need to pass the challenge to get `root`: <br>
Each user has some puzzle that needed to be solved in order to go to the next user. <br>
`lmezard -> laurie -> thor -> zaz `

At the end, we'll be able to escalate our privilege to `root`.
